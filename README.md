### General Description:

This project consists of multiple Python modules (`customer.py`, `restaurant.py`, `review.py`, and `main.py`) that are designed to implement a system for managing customer reviews for different restaurants. It models a scenario where customers can leave reviews for various restaurants, and the system allows for the management of customers, restaurants, and reviews.

### Overall Flow:

1. `Customers` are defined using the Customer class in customer.py. They can leave reviews for restaurants and access various details about their interactions with restaurants.

2. `Restaurants` are represented by the Restaurant class in restaurant.py. They can retrieve reviews, customer names, and average star ratings based on customer reviews.

3. `Reviews` are managed by the Review class in review.py. Reviews are associated with customers and restaurants, and their details are stored in the REVIEW_LIST.

4. The `main.py` module demonstrates interactions between customers, restaurants, and reviews. It creates instances of customers, restaurants, and reviews, and showcases various methods provided by these classes.
